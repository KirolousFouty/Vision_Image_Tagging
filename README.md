## Description:
- Computer Vision and Image Tagging project. Streamlining the process of extracting images from documents, extracting separate entities from each image, and tagging each, separately, with relevant metadata, specifically focusing on handling Arabic text. The solution combines several open-source tools for image processing, text extraction, object detection, and natural language processing (NLP). Creating a searchable database of images classified by hierarchically ordered categories relevant to the geographic and cultural context of the AUC Libraries' digital collections.

## Tools used:
- Used Colab, GitHub, Web Scraping, OpenCV, Gemini, Tesseract OCR, Keras, YOLO, InceptionV3, DenseNet-201, Pix2Pix, DeOldify, VGG16, ResNet, Florence-2, PyQt.
